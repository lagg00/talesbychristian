      title: "Let Me Explain",
      content: `In 4th, 5th, and 6th grade, most people thought I was gay.

I'm not.

That led to horrible things — things I won’t talk about here because they’re too personal. But just know, it hurt. A lot.

One girl even apologized and still said, “even though you are.” Like she already made up her mind. That’s how it felt... like no one ever really listened.

And when I needed help the most, the principals didn’t do much. The bullies didn’t stop. No threat made it better.

But through all that, two friends were there for me. They helped more than they know.

I’m going into 7th grade now, and I want to start sharing what happened — especially how it felt at the end of 6th grade.

Just remember this:

You don’t know the silent battles people go through.

Be kind. Think first. Because I survived it. But not everyone does.

So let me explain.`

      title: "Did I Walk Gay?",
      content: `March 31 2025 @ 8:28 AM
      It wasn’t a far walk at all — just from my classroom to the next room over, the music room. I was asked by my band teacher to bring a chair there because the music room is where kids who don’t do band hang out during class. Simple enough, right?

But even though it was just a few steps, I felt something heavy the moment I stepped inside. It was like every eye in the room turned toward me, watching, waiting, judging. I could almost feel their silent whispers in the air, even if they didn’t say a word out loud. That feeling of being stared at — it’s hard to explain, but it’s one of the worst things I’ve felt at school.

I told the music teacher, “I’m going to set the chair here,” pointing to a stack of chairs she had nearby. She said okay, not looking up from what she was doing. Before I left the room, I said bye to Noah, a friend who was sitting there. Then I started walking out.

And that’s when I heard it — the words that hit me like a slap: “He’s so gay.” A laugh followed, light but cutting. I froze for a moment, unsure if I heard right or if I imagined it. But no, it was real. People were saying things about me again.

I walked back to my band room, heart pounding and mind racing with a thousand questions. Did I act differently? Did I walk a certain way? What did I do to make them say that? Was it the way I smiled? The way I talked? Or just who I am? Those thoughts swirled around in my head, and for a moment, I felt lost.

I told myself I was being dramatic — that maybe I was overthinking it. But deep down, I knew it wasn’t just in my head. It hurt. A lot.

What’s worse is that it’s all false. None of it is true. I don’t know why people would say such things or why they want to believe rumors and lies about me. It’s painful to think that false information spreads so quickly, especially to new kids who don’t know me at all. When rumors get around, they change how people see you — before you even get a chance to show who you really are.

I have only a few close friends, and sometimes I wonder if they really know what’s being said behind my back. It’s confusing because sometimes I sense something’s off, but I can’t prove it or confront it. That feeling — not knowing who to trust, who’s talking — makes everything feel heavier.

The world feels crazy sometimes. Being judged for something that’s not even true is maddening. I try to remind myself that I’m not defined by what others say. But it’s hard when the whispers follow you down the halls and into the classrooms every day.

Imagine being called something terrible, like a murderer, when you’ve never hurt anyone. How would that feel? Would you keep trying to be yourself, or would you start hiding behind a mask, pretending not to care?

That’s how I feel.

I’m just a kid trying to get through school, make friends, and figure out who I am. But sometimes, the weight of what others think or say is almost too much to bear.

Still, I keep going. I have to.

Because this isn’t the whole story. I’m more than the rumors, more than the names. I’m someone who deserves kindness, respect, and understanding.

And someday, maybe people will see that too.`
